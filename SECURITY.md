# Iceblink Security Policy

Iceblink is a 2FA authentication app developed by Snowcone Labs. We take
security extremely seriously in our products, and value efforts by security
researchers. If you have found a potentional security issue, we encourage you to
report it. TA his will improve the security of our users, and your contribution
will be highlighted unless requested otherwise. After reporting a vulnerability,
we aim to provide a first response within 48 hours. Developing a fix will be
prioritized. After discussing the patch with the reporter, we will create a
release documenting the security issue. A GitHub security advisory will also be
published.
